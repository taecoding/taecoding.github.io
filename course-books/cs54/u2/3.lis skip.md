# Longest Increasing Subsequence

We have discussed Overlapping Subproblems and Optimal Substructure properties.

Let us discuss Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS) problem as an example problem that can be solved using Dynamic Programming.

The Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS) problem is to find the length of the longest subsequence of a given sequence such that all elements of the subsequence are sorted in increasing order. For example, the length of LIS for {10, 22, 9, 33, 21, 50, 41, 60, 80} is 6 and LIS is {10, 22, 33, 50, 60, 80}.

```python
""" To make use of recursive calls, this function must return 
 two things: 
 1) Length of LIS ending with element arr[n-1]. We use 
 max_ending_here for this purpose 
 2) Overall maximum as the LIS may end with an element 
 before arr[n-1] max_ref is used this purpose. 
 The value of LIS of full array of size n is stored in 
 *max_ref which is our final result """
  
# global variable to store the maximum 
global maximum 
  
def _lis(arr , n ): 
  
    # to allow the access of global variable 
    global maximum 
  
    # Base Case 
    if n == 1 : 
        return 1
  
    # maxEndingHere is the length of LIS ending with arr[n-1] 
    maxEndingHere = 1
  
    """Recursively get all LIS ending with arr[0], arr[1]..arr[n-2] 
       IF arr[n-1] is maller than arr[n-1], and max ending with 
       arr[n-1] needs to be updated, then update it"""
    for i in xrange(1, n): 
        res = _lis(arr , i) 
        if arr[i-1] < arr[n-1] and res+1 > maxEndingHere: 
            maxEndingHere = res +1
  
    # Compare maxEndingHere with overall maximum. And 
    # update the overall maximum if needed 
    maximum = max(maximum , maxEndingHere) 
  
    return maxEndingHere 
  
def lis(arr): 
  
    # to allow the access of global variable 
    global maximum 
  
    # lenght of arr 
    n = len(arr) 
  
    # maximum variable holds the result 
    maximum = 1
  
    # The function _lis() stores its result in maximum 
    _lis(arr , n) 
  
    return maximum

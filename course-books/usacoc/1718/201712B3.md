<div align="left" class="problem-text" >
<span id="probtext-text" class="mathjax">Farmer John purchases three cows: Bessie, Elsie, and Mildred, each of whom
initially produces 7 gallons of milk per day.  Since the milk output of a cow is
known to potentially change over time, Farmer John takes periodic measurements
over the next 100 days and scribbles them down in a log book.  Entries in his
log look like this:

<p></p><pre>35 Bessie -2
14 Mildred +3
</pre>

<p>The first entry indicates that on day 35, Bessie's milk output was 2 gallons
lower than it was when last measured.  The next entry indicates that on day 14,
Mildred's  milk output increased by 3 gallons from when it was last measured. 
Farmer John has only enough time to make at most one measurement on any given
day.  Unfortunately, he is a bit disorganized, and doesn't necessarily write
down his measurements in chronological order.  

</p><p>To keep his cows motivated, Farmer John proudly displays on the wall of his barn
the picture of whichever cow currently has the highest milk output (if several
cows tie for the highest milk output, he displays all of their pictures). 
Please determine the number of days on which Farmer John would have needed to
change this display.

specifying  a day (an integer in the range 1..100), the name of a cow, and the
change in her  milk output since it was last measured (a nonzero integer).  Each
cow's milk output will always be in the  range 0..1000.

<p></p><div class="prob-out-spec"><h4>OUTPUT FORMAT (file measurement.out):</h4>
Please output the number of days (an integer in the range 0..100) on which
Farmer John needs to adjust his motivational display.
</div>

<p></p><h4>SAMPLE INPUT:</h4><pre class="in">4
7 Mildred +3
4 Elsie -1
9 Mildred -1
1 Bessie +2
</pre><h4>SAMPLE OUTPUT:</h4> <pre class="out">3
</pre>

<p>Initially, all cows have milk output 7.  On day 1, Bessie's milk output
increases to 9, making her the unique cow with highest milk output and causing
Farmer John to change his display.  On day 4, Elsie's milk output decreases to
6, but this does not change the fact that Bessie is the sole cow in the lead. 
On day 7, Mildred jumps into the  lead, changing the display, and on day 9,
Mildred drops in production to be tied with Bessie, again changing the display.

# TAE (*T*echnology *A*pplied *E*ducation) Code Academy
Computers and software are changing everything around us. We believe coding is a foundational skill for the 21st century, just like reading and writing.  Smart phones and computers are the platforms for innovation – they allow dreamers, idealists and entrepreneurs in the world to bring their ideas into reality.  The key resource is knowing how to write the software that drives our modern world.

At TAE Academy, our goal is to provide our students with great curriculum, tools, and resources in order to empower them to meaningfully impact their future.

# Courses

## CS 101 PROGRAMMING FUNDAMENTALS
This course introduces fundamental programming concepts using a programming language developed by the prestigious Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) called Scratch.  The key feature in Scratch is the use of graphical command code blocks.  Using these code blocks eliminates command typing and syntax errors, while emphasizing the use of core programming concepts. This course will build an essential foundation for more complex and advanced programming languages such as PYTHON and JAVA.   The course is comprised of twelve 2 hour sessions.  The following topics are covered in the course:

* Motion and Drawing
* Procedure: broadcasting and receiving, custom Procedure, parameters, arguments
* Variables: data type, variable scope, user input
* Decision: comparison operators, logical operators, if-else statement
* Repetition: counter-controlled loop, event-controlled loop, three components in loop, user input validation, nested loop, recursion
* String: counting special characters, palindrome, string manipulation, fix my spelling, binary to decimal conversion
* List: CRUD operations, min, max, search, frequency, bubble sort, median

## CS 102 FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING
This course is part two of the programming fundamentals series. The course will briefly revisit the basic programming constructs that were covered in the earlier course and move on to powerful, higher-order programming constructs, as well as advanced programming abstracts in Python.  The course is comprised of twelve 2 hour sessions.  The following topics are covered in the course:

* Basic Console Interaction: printing, variables and types, mathematical operations, user input
* Control Flow: comments, Booleans, if statements, comparison operators, logical operators, short circuit evaluation, floating point numbers and rounding, while loops, for loops, break and structures, functions, functions and parameters, functions and return values, exceptions
* Strings: indexing, immutability, slicing and concatenation, strings and for loops, the IN keyword, string methods
* Data Structure: tuples, lists, list methods, 2d lists, list comprehensions, packing and unpacking, dictionaries, equivalence vs, identity

## CS JAVA AP
This course is designed for mid- to advanced-level students who wish to master the basics of Java and/or are preparing for the College Board AP Computer Science A Exam at the end of the school year.

## CS Olympiad
This track introduces students to the required skills and foundational concepts of computer science in order to prepare for the USA Computing Olympiad.

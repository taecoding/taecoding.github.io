#Problem 1. Milk Pails

Farmer John has received an order for exactly MM units of milk (1≤M≤1,0001≤M≤1,000) that he needs to fill right away. Unfortunately, his fancy milking machine has just become broken, and all he has are three milk pails of integer sizes XX, YY, and MM (1≤X<Y<M1≤X<Y<M). All three pails are initially empty. Using these three pails, he can perform any number of the following two types of operations:
- He can fill the smallest pail (of size XX) completely to the top with XX units of milk and pour it into the size-MM pail, as long as this will not cause the size-MM pail to overflow.

- He can fill the medium-sized pail (of size YY) completely to the top with YY units of milk and pour it into the size-MM pail, as long as this will not cause the size-MM pail to overflow.

Although FJ realizes he may not be able to completely fill the size-MM pail, please help him determine the maximum amount of milk he can possibly add to this pail.

##INPUT FORMAT (file pails.in):

The first, and only line of input, contains XX, YY, and MM, separated by spaces.
##OUTPUT FORMAT (file pails.out):

Output the maximum amount of milk FJ can possibly add to the size-MM pail.

##SAMPLE INPUT:

17 25 77

##SAMPLE OUTPUT:

76
In this example, FJ fills the pail of size 17 three times and the pail of size 25 once, accumulating a total of 76 units of milk.

#Problem 2. Circular Barn

Being a fan of contemporary architecture, Farmer John has built a new barn in the shape of a perfect circle. Inside, the barn consists of a ring of nn rooms, numbered clockwise from 1…n1…n around the perimeter of the barn (3≤n≤1,0003≤n≤1,000). Each room has doors to its two neighboring rooms, and also a door opening to the exterior of the barn.
Farmer John wants exactly riri cows to end up in each room ii (1≤ri≤1001≤ri≤100). To herd the cows into the barn in an orderly fashion, he plans to unlock the exterior door of a single room, allowing the cows to enter through that door. Each cow then walks clockwise through the rooms until she reaches a suitable destination. Farmer John wants to unlock the exterior door that will cause his cows to collectively walk a minimum total amount of distance. Please determine the minimum total distance his cows will need to walk, if he chooses the best such door to unlock. The distance walked by a single cow is the number of interior doors through which she passes.

##INPUT FORMAT (file cbarn.in):

The first line of input contains nn. Each of the remaining nn lines contain r1…rnr1…rn.
##OUTPUT FORMAT (file cbarn.out):

Please write out the minimum total amount of distance the cows collectively need to travel.
##SAMPLE INPUT:
```
5
4
7
8
6
4
```
##SAMPLE OUTPUT:

48
In this example, the best solution is to let the cows enter through the door of the room that requires 7 cows.

# Writing Hello World
Writing a program that prints "Hello World" to the console.
```code
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args){
        System.out.println("Hello, world!");
    }
}
```

There are a few key parts to pay attention to here:
* class: A unit of code that is the basic building block of program.
* main method: the first method called by JVM.
* public static: accessible by any caller(JVM)
* System.out.println: print out the argument to the console
* statement: end with semicolon
